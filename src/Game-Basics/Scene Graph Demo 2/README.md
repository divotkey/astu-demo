# Scene Graph Demo 2

This example shows how to draw a triangle and other shapes using the scene
graph. The example consists only of the main file `main.cpp` and a service
`MainService` that configures the scene graph to draw the triangle.

Unlike Scene Graph Demo1, in this demo, we use the builder classes to configure
the scene graph.
