# Camera Demo

This example shows how to perform a world-to-screen transformation using cameras and the CameraSystem. The default camera is configured to always display a 16 by 9 meter section of the game world, regardless of the size of the output window. 

The `CameraControlService` additionally allows to change the section of the game world by changing the camera position with the right mouse button. With the mouse wheel the zoom factor of the camera can be changed. Pressing the `Home` button resets the camera position and the zoom.
