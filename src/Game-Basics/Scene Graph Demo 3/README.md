# Scene Graph Demo 3

This example shows how the camera service can be used to use cameras that
perform a world-to-screen transformation. The output is automatically centered
by using the camera. It is also possible to set which area of the game world
should be visible. The game world is no longer defined in pixels but in world
units, which are best seen as meters or centimeters.
